# collatz conjecture implemented using numpy

Unsolved problem in mathematics: Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values? 

Select any number you want: Triple the number and add one if it is odd. Divide the number in half if it is even. With that new number, carry out the procedure several times. If you do this, you'll soon be stuck in a loop. At the very least, that is what we anticipate taking place.

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n+1 conjecture, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It states that for any positive integer, if it is even, divide it by 2, and if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the resulting number, and it will eventually reach the number 1.

The reason why the Collatz conjecture is difficult to prove for any positive integer lies in its complex and unpredictable nature. While the conjecture has been tested extensively using computers and has been found to hold true for an incredibly large range of numbers, no one has been able to provide a general proof that guarantees it holds for all positive integers.

One of the main challenges in proving the Collatz conjecture is the intricate interplay between odd and even numbers. The process involves a combination of multiplication, addition, and division operations, which introduces a high level of complexity and makes it difficult to establish a clear pattern or approach for proving the conjecture.

Additionally, the behavior of the Collatz sequence generated by each positive integer is highly irregular. Some sequences grow very slowly, while others exhibit erratic behavior, with numbers increasing and decreasing in seemingly unpredictable patterns. This irregularity makes it challenging to derive a consistent and comprehensive proof strategy that applies to all numbers.
